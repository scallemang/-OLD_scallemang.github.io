I’m not a very good reader; and I’m not very good with literary theory. So, god knows why but I spend a bit of time trying to further acquaint myself with – in the very least – some of the basics of criticism.  In order to help keep myself from ‘losing the plot’ of the work, I am writing notes – crib sheets – as I read Terry Eagleton’s famous Literary Theory: An Introduction.  So, then, here we go, as I post them for my own edification and access, if no one else’s – though if, hapless stranger, you have stumbled upon this, feel free to add your corrections, thoughts, and suggestions in the comments.

(N.B. I try to use quotation marks where appropriate, but – this being wholly informal, and about trying to process the ideas more than pay tribute to the text per se – I may quote without signification; no page numbers are cited.)

## What is Literature?

Literary theory is the theory of literature. So, then, what is literature?

## Is Literature IMAGINATIVE WRITING?

Not necessarily; much that is considered literature is not typically imaginative – certain (but by no means all) essays, orations, treatises, and so on are literature without the extensive invention of other literary genres.

Fact and fiction is a fairly recent binary: ancient sagas blended the two; early ‘novels’ could be journalistic (i.e. ‘fact’-based); earlier (vis-à-vis the present) news reports were not always (often?) considered purely factual.

**SOME HISTORY IS LITERATURE:** The standards by which we divide and differentiate history from literature are modern: the Bible’s authors, and Gibbon, e.g., likely thought they were writing the truth; we don’t think they wrote the truth.

**SOME FICTION IS NOT LITERATURE:** comic books and some genre novels – whether inherently (i.e. generically) trashy or simply poorly executed – are not considered literature.

Any genre can admit creativity and imagination, without it becoming literature per se; in other words, creativity and imagination aren’t the property of literature alone.

## Is Literature WRITING THAT USES LANGUAGE IN CERTAIN WAYS?

Literature ‘transforms and intensifies ordinary language, deviates systematically from everyday speech'; it is ‘organized violence committed on ordinary speech’ (Roman Jakobson).

This is the position of Russian Formalists.  They distanced themselves from mystical symbolist approaches; they wished to look, quasi-scientifically, at how texts worked, in technical terms.  Literature has ‘its own … laws, structures and devices'; Literature can be analysed, like a machine made of words.  They were not interested in content; content was the fodder, the excuse for literature – literary studies should be divorced from psychology and sociology, which means it should not bother with content.

Formalists studied Literature as a collection of devices – sound, imagery, syntax, etc. – and no more than that.  These devices estranged and defamiliarized the material to which they were applied.  Our real world conversations are ‘automatized'; literature makes language more noticeable, makes the objects recorded more ‘perceptible.’

**A PROBLEM:** To the Formalists, Literature is language that deviates from the norm – but what is the norm? The ordinary language of the ivory tower is generally unlike the ordinary language of labourers; the ordinary language of courtship is generally unlike the ordinary language of religious discourse.  There is no one, single normal language; only a collection of discourses.

**ANOTHER PROBLEM:** Not all ‘deviatory’ language is Literature: slang, for example is ‘abnormal’, but not Literature.

Formalists recognized that literature’s capacity to estrange only worked ‘against a certain normative linguistic background’ – if language became more poetic, old poetry would seem quotidian, for instance; therefore, “‘literariness’ was a function of the differential relations between one sort of discourse and another’.  So, they were finally interested in ‘literariness’ above literature – n.b. literariness could be found in literary texts, but also outside of them, in slang and other artful non-literary (in the conventional sense) discourses.

**A PROBLEM:** Much of literature is not obviously estranging, does not draw particular attention to itself – realistic dialogue is not obviously literary; but we know it’s literature because we study it as literature – its context tells us that it is literary, even if the language does not distinguish itself.

This Formalism was really designed for poetry; when the Formalists dealt with prose, they applied the same techniques; but there are many other critical approaches merited by prose – realistic, naturalistic writing is not so very self-conscious or self-exhibiting; how should we study it?

**ANOTHER PROBLEM:** Nearly any kind of writing can be read as estranging – e.g., different words with shared spelling can cause confusion/ambiguity, if context and common sense are not employed; nearly any kind of writing can be read as poetic and device-rich – which suggests, perhaps, literature is whatever is created by or analysed with these literary critical processes.

However, this remains poetic analysis; but literature is (considered) more than only poetry.

### Is Literature WRITING THAT HAS GENERAL, EVEN COSMIC SIGNIFICANCE; WRITING THAT HAS WIDER AND PROBABLY DEEPER IMPORT; is it ‘NON-PRAGMATIC’ DISCOURSE?

Literature ‘serves no immediate practical purpose’ and ‘[refers] to a general state of affairs.’

Because it generalized (or is available to be generalized), Literature may ’employ peculiar language’, may be a ‘way of talking’, a ‘self-referential language.’

**A PROBLEM:** Much literature – essays, e.g. – mustn’t be divorced from their content; their ‘point’ is not simply the effects, devices, or non-pragmatic notions collected therein; much literature was written with pragmatic motives (political essays, e.g.).

**ANOTHER PROBLEM:** ‘non-pragmatic’ reading privileges interpretation, privileges the reader’s search for significance. Which means, if true: Literature cannot be ‘objectively’ defined; rather, definition comes from one’s choices as a reader, one’s method of reading – not from the nature of what is written.

Also: obviously ‘non-pragmatic’ writing can be read pragmatically – a poem encodes the vocabulary of the poet’s time and place, his points of reference, aspects of social organization and relationships, e.g.

Moreover: are we only reading, for example, essays with a ‘literary’ appreciation if we generalize them, looking for what they say about the human condition?  Is our appreciation not ‘literary’ if we cannot find general, ‘cosmic’ truths in a work?

There are not, on this account, inherent qualities of literature; literature is made by the ‘number of ways in which people relate themselves to writing'; literature is ‘any kind of writing which … somebody values highly.’ This is a functional, not an ontological definition.

**A PROBLEM** with the ‘practical’-‘non-practical’ binary: this is a historically specific binary; other societies derive much that is practical from their literature.

## Is Literature FINE WRITING?

**A problem:** This would mean that ‘bad literature’ is impossible.

Perhaps the writing itself doesn’t have to be ‘fine’, but it has to belong to a kind that is considered ‘fine’ – it can be a better or worse example of ‘fine writing’/belles lettres: it is a genre, with good and bad examples.

**A PROBLEM:** there is NO objectivity in this definition.  People’s opinions about literature may change – and this changes what ‘is’ and ‘isn’t’ literature. A canon is completely a construct. No work is valuable in and of itself; value is a transitive term.

Subjectivity in defining literature may not be incompatible with an enduring canon:

+ We may still share many of the same preoccupations with the work and its milieu
+ The work may be – what’s the word? – imprecise enough that we can remake it every generation; in other words, it ‘leaves room’ for the imposition of changing values and critical approaches; there are opportunities for engagement with such works across time and place.

A subjective definition of literature is unstable: not unstable because values are unstable per se, with facts as their stable counterpart; unstable because the decision to acknowledge one fact over another itself encodes a value system and is variable – e.g., it’s easy to picture another society in which intelligence is privileged above beauty, in which the ‘facts’ given about a smart, overweight person would be coloured entirely differently than in a society wherein the valuation is reversed.  Statements presume ‘that those statements are worth making, perhaps more worth making than certain others’.

Factual statements may often be ‘phatic’, or concerned with the art of communication itself – they may establish rapport, build trust, establish authority through the exchange of information (or through a giving-taking of information, as they case may be).  All knowledge, all thoughts are the results of value-judgements – even the suggestion that knowledge should be ‘value-free’!

A note on individual values: subjectivity is only permitted within parameters that reflect a society’s values, i.e. the limits imposed by a culture upon the values of an individual – cultural values demarcate the extremes of its citizens’ values.

These social values – the ‘largely concealed structure of values which informs and underlies our factual statements’ – is an aspect of ideology.  N.b. Ideology does not refer to every instance of every deeply held belief of members within a certain society, but only those ‘which have some kind of relation to the maintenance and reproduction of social power.’  An example is given: in one experiment (of IA Richards, for what it’s worth), students failed to positively differentiate canonical authors from obscure ones – however, what they looked for, the criteria by which they measured these works, was repetitive and predictable.  Their subjectivity was exercised within an ideological framework; they picked the ‘wrong’ authors, though they used the ‘right’ criteria; their picks could be called ‘their own’, but their values were ideological – and the ownership of their choices is, ipso facto, complicated to say the least.

Literature cannot be pinned down as ‘objective’ and descriptive; it cannot be pinned down as whimsically ‘subjective’ – for subjectivity exists within defined limits of permitted beliefs (which are, we might say, ‘factual’ or, at least, as ‘unshakeable as the Empire State Building’).
