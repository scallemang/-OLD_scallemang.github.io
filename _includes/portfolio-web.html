              <p>Much of my (paid) work comes from delivering on clients&rsquo; feature requests as part of a team on sites I&rsquo;ve inherited—you know, the old PSD > HTML process. I&rsquo;ll probably add some of those items here shortly (buttons with CSS3 transitions! OMG!), but this is mostly—not entirely—hobbyist stuff for now.</p>

              <p>A tribute to a friend who passed away and a gift to his friends, family and partner, I repurposed <a href="http://livinthestream.blogspot.ca/">Chris&rsquo; Blogspot blog</a> using <a href="http://www.turnjs.com/">Turn.js</a>. A labour of love. (All sincerity aside, the code could probably use some tidying up; I did this about a year after first getting started with HTML.)</p>

              <p>This very site—here! This one! You&rsquo;re looking at it!—was an excuse to a) learn Jekyll, b) roll a Swiss Design-inspired personal site (I was reading a book on Helvetica when I started sketching this out), and c) get to know Bootstrap a little better. A great learning experience: still plenty to improve, but I leveled up my programming concepts in thinking about how to loop through pages in the menu and assign <code>active</code> classes where appropriate.</p>
              <p>Getting categories and tags to work on GitHub pages (which restricts Jekyll plugin use) was educational: this blogpost on <a href="http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/" target="_blank">MindDust</a> was vital in setting this up.</p>

              <h4>Wild Bore album site <em>(WIP)</em></h4>
              <p>A site for an album by Wild Bore (a project of some friends and me). The album still needs some edits and remixing. Anyway: I wanted a site where each song has its own window, in a sense. And I wanted a nice scroll effect between songs when you click the menu.</p>
              <p>I made one version &lsquo;branded&rsquo; to the album&rsquo;s artwork, another compiling quirky images that I thought created a mood of weirdness and discomfort (some nasty CSS adds to this).</p>

              <p>Still very much a work in progress, but this is the first WP theme I&rsquo;ve built from scratch. (Well, using Bootstrap quite clearly.) Content is the priority for now, though I&rsquo;ll simultaneously read up on using the _s theme and possibly refactoring this.</p>

              <h4>GitHub repo: Jekyll + tags and categories for GitHub pages</h4>
              <p>After struggling to set my own Jekyll page up on GH pages with working tags and categories, I took an out-of-the-box Jekyll installation and tried to add as little code as possible to enable category and tag pages on your GitHub Jekyll blog. Fingers crossed, the README will help the user get the rest of the way.</p>
